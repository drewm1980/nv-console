This is a minimalist note-taking program.  It will be VERY familiar to users of
the Notational Velocity note taking program on os x.

The program consists of three panes:
1. A text field where you type a search string to search within existing notes, or
type the name for a new note.
2. A list of notes that match the string from window 1.
3. A window where you can edit the selected note

The program is always in one of two states, toggled with the Tab key:
1. Searching/Creating notes
2. Editing

Thanks to:

Zachary Schneirov for developing the excellent Notational Velocity program,
after which this program is modelled.
